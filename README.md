# COVID-19-Plotting-CONFIRMED-cases-MAP-for-USA-County-Wise
Plotting the CONFIRMED cases MAP for USA county Wise for all Lower48 states of the USA

# I used the latest information on County Wise COVID19 data from Github website (updated from JHU datasource)
# Data is there for each county in the USA;
# Downloaded shape file for all counties in the USA from data.gov website
# Used the GEOID tag in the Shape File to differentiate all the Counties in the USA
# GEOID is StateFP + CountyFP
# Written code to store the last 5 days of MAP only, as it take more time for each map generation with 3107 counties in lower48 states
